    <h2>Article of Andrew Jackson</h2>
    <p>Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the seventh president
    of the United States from 1829 to 1837. Before his presidency, he rose to fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served
    in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Jackson's legacy is controversial. He has been praised as an advocate for working
    Americans and preserving the union of states, and criticized for his racist policies, particularly towards Native
    Americans. His political philosophy became the basis for the Democratic Party.
    
    Jackson was born in the colonial Carolinas before the American Revolutionary War. He became a frontier lawyer and
    married Rachel Donelson Robards. He briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate,
    representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Superior Court from 1798 until 1804.
    Jackson purchased a plantation later known as the Hermitage, becoming a wealthy planter who profited off the forced
    labor of hundreds of enslaved African Americans during his lifetime. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee
    militia and was elected its commander. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813–1814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe
    Bend and negotiating the Treaty of Fort Jackson that required the indigenous Creek population to surrender vast tracts
    of present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory at the Battle of New
    Orleans in 1815 made him a national hero. He later commanded U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the
    annexation of Florida from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the
    Senate. He ran for president in 1824. He won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote, but no candidate won the
    electoral majority. With the help of Henry Clay, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams as president.
    Jackson's supporters alleged that there was a "corrupt bargain" between Adams and Clay and began creating a new
    political coalition that became the Democratic Party in the 1830s.
    
    Jackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide despite issues such as his slave trading and his "irregular"
    marriage. In 1830, he signed the Indian Removal Act. This act, which has been described as ethnic cleansing, displaced
    tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands
    of deaths. Jackson faced a challenge to the integrity of the federal union when South Carolina threatened to nullify a
    high protective tariff set by the federal government. He threatened the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but
    the crisis was defused when it was amended. In 1832, he vetoed a bill by Congress to reauthorize the Second Bank of the
    United States, arguing that it was a corrupt institution. After a lengthy struggle, the Bank was dismantled. In 1835,
    Jackson became the only president to pay off the national debt. After leaving office, Jackson supported the presidencies
    of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk, as well as the annexation of Texas.
    
    Contemporary opinions about Jackson are often polarized. Supporters characterize him as a defender of democracy and the
    U.S. Constitution, while critics point to his reputation as a demagogue who ignored the law when it suited him.
    Scholarly rankings of U.S. presidents historically rated Jackson's presidency as above average. Since the late 20th
    century, his reputation declined, and in the 21st century his placement in rankings of presidents fell.</p>

            After eight years as President I have only two regrets: that I have not shot Henry Clay or hanged John C. Calhoun.
